# Model performance

The model was evaluated on a held-out test set consisting of microscope images not used during training.

## Quantitative metrics

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Precision | 0.68 |
| Recall | 0.60 |
| mAP@0.50 | 0.62 |
| mAP@0.50–0.95 | 0.48 |

These values reflect the difficulty of pollen morphology, strong class imbalance, and taxonomic similarity between pollen types. Performance is sufficient for semi-automated pollen detection and relative abundance estimation.

# Example predictions

This folder contains representative examples of correct model predictions on validation images.

The examples demonstrate:
- Accurate detection and classification of common and abundant pollen taxa (e.g. Pine, Artemisia, Lycopodium, Poaceae)
- Correct identification of morphologically distinctive taxa (e.g. Pediastrum integrum, Alnus viridis)
- Robust performance in images containing multiple pollen types and non-pollen particles (e.g. charcoal)

All examples shown here represent successful detections and illustrate the model’s strengths under favorable imaging conditions.
